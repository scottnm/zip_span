what am I learning?
- fence post problems with metaprogramming (whether through templates or otherwise) SUCK
- metaprogramming when abused can lead to code that is more reusable, but less easily modifiable. in this scenario, it may very well have taken less time to just hand write all variants of the zip_iterator and zip_span I cared about
- c++ template error messages are terrible and it upsets me to no end that I've wasted enough time reading them that I'm starting to figure them out.
